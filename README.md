# Summary

This is a small blog website built using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. The blog data is retrieved via an API endpoint from a JSON storage bin hosted by **npoint.io**. 
The Contact Me form is powered by WTForms. The theme for the blog is the 'Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog v6.0.9' theme (licensed under MIT) from startbootstrap.com.

## Notes

- Currently contains nonsense example blog posts.
- Could use further reduction of repetition amongst the HTML files.
